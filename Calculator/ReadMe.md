# README for Calculator Project by Raghav Singh

## Introduction
This GitHub repository contains the source code for a sophisticated calculator application developed by Raghav Singh. The calculator handles basic arithmetic operations and is implemented in Python. It features a command-line interface as well as a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

## Repository Structure
The repository includes the following key components:
- `calculator.py`: Core logic for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.
- `stack.py`: Implementation of a Stack class, utilized in `calculator.py` for expression evaluation.
- `tree.py`: Implementation of binary and expression trees for handling arithmetic operations.
- `calculatorGUI.py`: GUI for the calculator, built using the Tkinter library.

## Features
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Handles basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- **Expression Handling:** Can evaluate expressions with proper order of operations.
- **Graphical User Interface:** A user-friendly GUI for easier interaction.

## Usage
1. **Command-Line Calculator:**
   - Run `calculator.py` and input arithmetic expressions when prompted.
   - To exit, enter 'quit' or 'q'.

2. **Graphical Calculator:**
   - Run `calculatorGUI.py` to open the GUI.
   - Input expressions using the graphical buttons and view results on the screen.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. No external libraries are required for `calculator.py`. For the GUI (`calculatorGUI.py`), Tkinter needs to be installed, which is typically included in standard Python distributions.

## Running the Tests
- The `calculator.py`, `stack.py`, and `tree.py` files include test cases at the bottom. Run these files individually to execute the tests.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter for the GUI (usually comes with Python)
