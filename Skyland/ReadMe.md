## Integration Overview

The "Atlantis" game can serve as a direct sequel or next stage following the completion of "Skyland." This transition can be achieved through various means, such as reaching a specific score, completing certain objectives in Skyland, or simply moving to the next level upon Skyland's completion.

## Transitioning from Skyland to Atlantis

End of Level 1 (Skyland):
Define a condition to mark the completion of Level 1. This could be a certain score, a final boss defeat, or reaching a specific game area.
Once this condition is met, trigger a transition sequence. This can be a simple screen fade-out, a congratulatory message, or a short animation.

# Introduction to Level 2 (Atlantis):

Begin with a brief introduction or story segue that connects Skyland to Atlantis. This can be a narrative text, a dialogue, or a cutscene.
Introduce the new environment and gameplay changes. Since Atlantis is underwater-themed, highlight these new elements to the player.
Game Mechanics and UI Adjustments:

If Atlantis introduces new mechanics (like swimming, avoiding sharks, or collecting underwater trophies), provide a quick tutorial or guide.
Update the game’s UI to reflect the new level’s theme. This could involve changing the color scheme, background, and UI elements to match the underwater Atlantis theme.

## Maintaining Continuity:

If there are carry-over elements from Skyland (like player score, lives, or certain abilities), ensure they are seamlessly integrated into Atlantis.
The transition should feel like a natural progression in the game, maintaining the player's immersion.

## Ensuring a Smooth Transition

Save and Load Features: Implement save points at the end of Skyland and the beginning of Atlantis, allowing players to resume their progress.
Balancing: Ensure that the difficulty of Atlantis is balanced with the progression from Skyland. The new level should present a challenge but not be overwhelmingly difficult.
Testing: Thoroughly playtest the transition to ensure there are no bugs or abrupt gameplay changes that could disrupt the player experience.

## Technical Implementation

In your game's main script or controller, define a function or a set of conditions that handle the level transition.
Ensure that all necessary resources for Atlantis are loaded and initialized upon entering Level 2.
Consider creating a unified game state or controller that manages both levels, ensuring smooth transitions and shared game logic.
