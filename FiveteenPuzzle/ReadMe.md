# FifteenPuzzle Game

Welcome to the "Fifteen" puzzle game repository. This classic sliding puzzle game involves a 4x4 grid with numbered tiles and one empty space. The project comprises two main components: `fifteen.py`, which contains the core game logic, and `game.py`, a graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive gameplay.

## Features

- **Core Gameplay:** Engage with the traditional 15-puzzle, sliding tiles on a 4x4 board to achieve order.
- **Randomized Start:** Each game begins with a shuffled board, ensuring a unique challenge.
- **Graphical User Interface:** A simple and clean GUI built using Tkinter enhances the playing experience.
- **Strategic Gameplay:** Develop and apply strategies to efficiently solve the puzzle.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone this repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/fifteen-game.git
```

## Game Mechanics

- **The Grid:** A 4x4 grid containing 15 numbered tiles and one blank space.
- **Objective:** Arrange the tiles in ascending numerical order, with the blank space in the bottom-right corner.
- **Tile Movement:** Slide tiles horizontally or vertically into the empty space.
- **Shuffling:** The game starts with a randomized tile arrangement.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Run `game.py`. A shuffled 4x4 grid appears.
2. **Make a Move:** Click a tile adjacent to the empty space to slide it.
3. **Solve the Puzzle:** Win by arranging the tiles from 1 to 15, with the empty space at the end.

## Game Strategy

- **Corner Tiles:** Begin by positioning the corner tiles correctly.
- **Row/Column Approach:** Solve one row or column at a time.
- **Minimize Disruptions:** Avoid moving tiles that are already in their correct position.
